## Setup your first Computer

When you first login to ImmyBot the Getting Started Wizard will be prompt you to create your ImmyBot flash drive, and plug it into the new computer.

**THIS IS A ONE TIME PROCESS, YOU DO NOT NEED TO CREATE A FLASH DRIVE FOR EACH CLIENT. YOU WILL CHANGE THE CLIENT AFTER THE MACHINE IS IN IMMYBOT**

**We recommend unboxing a physical computer (Dell, HP, or Lenovo) so we can demonstrate applying the latest manufacturer BIOS and driver updates.**

**If you insist on testing on a virtual machine, do the following to receive the PPKG inside an ISO, then mount it to the VM, and press the Windows Key 5 times when you are at the Region Selection screen. If you are past the region selection screen, simply double click the PPKG from the mounted disk**

Once the computer is identified, you will be directed to that computer to begin the Onboarding process:

ImmyBot needs:
1. Customer
2. Primary User (That will be using the computer, optional but recommended)

You only have one customer and one person right now, and it’s your MSP and you. That’s fine, we’ll pretend we’re setting up a computer for you and your MSP.

::: tip
Customers can be imported from your RMM or PSA, or by setting up the Azure integration
:::

::: tip
People are imported from your customers' Azure AD via the Azure integration
:::

An "Onboarding" session will be created for this computer, and ImmyBot will apply the "Recommended Deployments"

::: tip
You can add your own Deployments and re-run this session as many times as you like until everything is to your liking.
