### Automatic ImmyBot Agent Updates (Alpha)

When a computer attempts to run a script and we establish an ephemeral agent connection, we now also upgrade the ImmyBot Agent if it is outdated. This is currently in alpha and
can be opted into from the Application Preferences page.

### Improvements
- You can use the new ScriptTimeout attribute to override the default execution time of 60 seconds in integration scripts (Supports up to 300 seconds)
- Integrations supporting ISupportsHttpRequest now display the HttpRequest Uri
- Added integration release stage badges to indicate whether an integration is in the `Alpha`, `Beta`, or `Production` stage.
- Uninstalling software no longer enforces required parameters specified by the deployment.
- \[Alpha Opt-In\] `Write-Progress -Activity "Activity 1" -Status "Migrating"` Calling Write-Progress with both Activity and Status parameters creates a new row on the action in the session. This helps visualize the progress of long running tasks.
- Added BitLocker Status to the logical disk tab on the computer details page
- Added TPM Version to the overview on the computer details page
- Added disabled deploy button next to configuration tasks with a tooltip explaining that they cannot be deployed directly.  The missing deploy button was causing confusion.
- Added a docs link for agent identification failures under the computer page -> pending tab.
- Updated help text of desired software state - Latest Version, to read "Will install/update the software to the latest version"
- Added a link to the ordering page from the deployment list page
- Updated the execution order help text to read "All tasks that are limited to onboarding computers will
      be executed at the beginning of the session in the onboarding stage, following the
      sequence in which they are listed. Once the onboarding process is complete, we will proceed to
      execute all other actions, also in the order they are listed."
- Added 'Azure Tenant Problems Detected' notifications to indicate errors and other detected problems related to Azure tenants
- Made notification creation more performant
- Added User preference area and moved the theme toggle to it.
- Improved some UI color settings
- Creating, updating, and deleting schedules show up in the audit table.
- Maintenance tasks can now specify an integration to link
- Fixed an issue on startup that was causing some startup jobs to not run
- The logic that ensures we have online agents before running a script on a computer no longer runs if we have an active ephemeral agent connection
- Added `AssignmentScope` as a script parameter. Possible values are `CrossTenant`, `SingleTenant`, and `Individual`.
- When ImmyBot restarts, we no longer cancel sessions due to them being considered "outdated". This was an old piece of code that was there to prevent accidental reboots during business hours. This check is no longer needed since we check for active hours and business hours during the maintenance session when deciding if the computer needs to reboot.
- **Important** - ImmyBot agents that are installed with automatic onboarding will now **ALWAYS** automatically onboard.  Before, we would optionally not perform onboarding if the agent resolved to an existing computer that had previously run at least one maintenance session.
- Removed converted parameter values from parameter validation responses since it could possibility contain sensitive data and the value was not being used on the frontend
- `Invoke-CommandCached` and `Invoke-AtomicCommand` cmdlets are now available for use inside Filter Scripts.
- Action errors regarding missing/failed software prerequisites now show the software's name instead of the type and identifier.
- Changes to software prerequisites now show up in the audit table
- Added a link to the ImmyBot community forum to the navbar
- Minimizing the script editor persists any ephemeral tabs you had open.
- Extended the ephemeral agent disconnected text to say "This computer does not have an ephemeral agent. An ephemeral agent will connect when a script is run against this computer."
- Several new Azure-related notifications have been added
- Fixed an issue where multiple sidebars could be showing and overlapping at the same time
- Parameter descriptions are now always visible.  Before, they were only visible if you were overriding the default value.
- Improved styling of default value key/value pair parameters on the deployment form
- Improved serial execution of maintenance tasks by adding a more visible locking mechanism.  You can now see who the currently executing computer / session is.
- Added a check when creating or updating a deployment that warns you when a duplicate deployment is detected. You have the option to replace the existing deployment or fix the newer one such that it is no longer a duplicate.
- Schedules and Adhoc Deployments now apply batching to create the maintenance sessions.  We've seen about a 6x improvement in speed in creation.
- Debounced script editor changes to prevent Intellisense crashes
- You can now save scripts that have syntax errors by acknowledging the confirmation modal. Useful for saving unfinished scripts or scripts that may not actually have syntax errors when run on an endpoint
- Improved ImmyAgent setup when deploying new instances that should result in fewer errors and faster instance setup
- Improved performance of session cancellation by simplifying the database queries
- Adding an invisible Formatter, so that information can be easily hidden.  Using this to hide ParameterSetBinding messages.
- In the Debugger section Parameters and Variables, the subsections are now open by default
 - In the Script Details section for the Type dropdown, the Software Auto Update element has been removed
- Added integration capability `ISupportsAgentDownload`. Allowing integrations to provide their own "Download Installer" script.
- Added integration capability `ISupportsAuthenticatedDownload`. Allowing integrations to provide authentication information without leaking sensitive information.
- N-Central integration has finally graduated from Beta status, and can now be found in the Integrations page ðŸŽ‰

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where some ImmyBot tenants linked to Azure customers were getting reset to Partner type within ImmyBot
   - **For Customer tenants that are erroneously set to Partner in ImmyBot, you can fix these by finding the customer on the Azure Settings page, and unlinking/relinking it**
- Fixed an issue where full maintenance schedule sessions did not have the "Full Maintenance" tag in the sessions table
Fixed an issue with N-Central integration failing to re-authenticate after ~24hrs of running.
- Fixed an issue where starting ImmyBot remote control for an outdated agent was kicking off a session that contained actions other than the agent update.
- Fixed an issue with license descriptions now showing on the deployment page
- Fixed potential null reference exception on Deployment page when ValidateScript is used
- Fixed an issue where wiped computers were not being treated as wiped if an existing computer was found. A wiped computer is one where the hostname and OS install date are different that the computer we already see inside of ImmyBot.
- Fixed a divide by zero error that could occur while computing a software installer's download speed.
- Set the audit user text to show the user's email address if the user does not have a first or last name specified
- Fixed an issue where some ImmyAgent & Ephemeral Agent binaries included some unsigned assemblies, falsely triggering some security tooling like ThreatLocker.
- Fixed an issue where Immy Starter plans were able to select the schedules nav item
- Fixed an issue where resolving agent identification issues resulted in "404 - entity could not be found."
- Fixed an issue where resolving agent identification issues with "Let Immy Try again" was not doing anything.
- Fixed an issue where some ImmyBot agents were failing to connect to ImmyBot when it was re-installed
- Fixed an issue where only the ImmyBot team could view global dynamic integration types
- Fixed an issue with scheduling the user computer affinity job once a day
- Removed some old migration code that was delaying startup and potentially causing issues
- Fixed an issue where some Immy Agent upgrades would leave installs dead in the water due to a config parsing issue.
- Fixed an issue where sometimes analyzing an installer package would cause an IOException.
- Fixed an issue where a software prerequisite would not be installed if an "update if found" deployment for the prerequisite resulted in "no action" because it was not found on the endpoint. Now, an install action for the prerequisite will be created anyway.
- Fixed an issue where selecting text on expanded script-runs would collapse the script
- Fixed an issue with fetching CW Manage agreement products where the deployment would show "Server error. Please contact your Administrator." Occurred when CW Manage attempted to return several hundred agreement products.
- Fixed an issue running `invoke-immycommand` from a cloud script against a computer that would throw an error during the preflight check, "Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'psComputers')".
- Fixed issue removing previous pages breadcrumbs on the session list page
- Fixed an issue on the onboarding form where mandatory parameters would not show the input by default if the parameter was dynamically discovered
- Fixed several minor issues found with the agent installer download modal and the getting started wizard modal
- Fixed a caching issue with inserting session logs into the database
- Fixed a caching issue with detected software from a machine
- Fixed an issue where database queries to get a list of sorted deployments during a maintenance session were not being cached
- Fixed an issue where the Package Analyzer would throw a `The process cannot access the file` error
- Fixed issue with our script analyzer rule for detecting missing $using: in Invoke-ImmyCommand
- Fixed the N-Central issue that keeps appearing "InvalidLoginCredentialsException: New tab request failed!"
- ParameterSetBinding should not emit output.

### Notifications

#### Notification Sidebar

We have updated how our notification system works.

The bell icon in the navbar will provide a number of the unacknowledged notifications you have.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/bfedef8b-0e81-4e63-b114-5e1908af6b12)

The sidebar will show when clicking this icon.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/8e8bd0e6-5cfd-485f-8e2c-fb9b2b4438ec)

#### Notification History

You can access all notifications from the primary sidebar under "Show More" -> "Notifications". By default, it will only show you unacknowledged notifications. You can click the "reset" link or change the filter on the "Acknowledgement" column to view acknowledged notifications.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/3b1dd160-7e04-4da1-8bf0-09c5c021b463)

#### Silencing notifications

From the notification sidebar, you can silence notifications by the notification type or for the specific object the notification was for.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/74f3d26c-0c5d-4f27-a954-17c2b0c3a046)

You can then view all of your silenced notifications from the notification history page.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/9d04a155-a82e-4d81-9732-e3e0fd79001f)

#### Notification Types

We have plenty of notification types in the pipeline.  Here are the notification types currently implemented.

1. Integration Unhealthy - a notification to let MSP users know that an integration has become unhealthy
2. Access Requested - a notification to let MSP users know that someone is requesting access to their instance of ImmyBot
3. Large Script Output - a notification to let MSP users know that a specific script has outputted a large amount of data. When scripts like this run during maintenance for hundreds of devices, it can easily cause high CPU and memory which leads to sluggish performance and potential crashes.
4. Unacknowledged Recommended Deployments - a notification to let MSP users know that there are new recommended deployments that need to be allowed or denied.

Some notification types that will be coming soon include, but are not limited to:

1. Agents Requires Manual Decision - a notification that lets MSP users know there are agents pending identification that could not be automatically resolved to a computer and require manual actions.
2. ImmyBot Updated - a notification that lets MSP users know that ImmyBot has been updated to a newer version
3. Cross-Tenant Deployment Requires Approval - a notification that lets MSP admin users know that a cross-tenant deployment was created or modified and needs approval from an MSP Admin. (Feature coming soon)
4. Azure related notifications

### Improvements
- Updated variable alert on the license details page to be the same alert shown on the software details page -> license help alert
- Added random jitter to the time we schedule some of our recurring jobs so that we reduce high database load due to all instances kicking off the jobs at the same time.
- For maintenance sessions that target a specific item, a session log has been added at the beginning that provides the name of the maintenance item
- Added auditing for static software versions and static maintenance task parameters
- Schedules that target a specific maintenance item will now always create a maintenance session for every computer resolved in the schedule's target group. If the computer does not have a deployment for the specified maintenance item, then the session will complete instantly with no actions added.
- Upgraded PowerShell Editor Services from 3.6 to 3.13
- Batch actions sidebar now slides out underneath the navbar to not block actions
- Batch actions sidebar background color was updated to provide more contrast
- You can now restart Intellisense from the status bar.
  - ![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/f10daf67-7113-402b-8686-be1e2c0692c0)
- Intellisense will restart automatically when changing script type.
- Removed dependency on Ace.js that shaved off 366KB from the project
- Made a slight performance change to schedule logic that should result in faster start times for schedules with many computers
- Added a "Job Args" property to the session details page info panel that expands to show more data associated with the session.
- ImmyBot no longer tries to run scripts against non-Pro N-Central agents
- Added custom PSScriptAnalyzerRule with Code Action to detect and fix missing $using: scope modifier in Invoke-ImmyCommand

## 0.58.2

Released 10-11-23

### Audit Page

An audit page was added that MSP admins can use to view changes made to objects such as Target Assignments and Scripts.  This also includes changes made to global objects.  This is part one of an effort to provide more transparency around changes made to global data. This page is accessible under Show More -> Audit, or "your-instance.immy.bot/settings/audit".

- Added support for incoming http request inspection to integration audit logging
- Added support for non-mandatory integration method parameters
- Dynamic Integrations that support agents can now specify whether the agent supports an online/offline status. Some integrations were defaulting to always online which caused issues with the pending connectivity logic
- Updated session log text about retrying to fetch PowerShell version
- Added a better error message when a dynamic version script returns a newer version than what was detected previously in the session. The message is "The dynamic version script is returning a newer version than what was retrieved the last time the script was ran. If so, re-deploy this action. We will automatically handle this scenario in a future release."

### Bug Fixes

## 0.58.0

Released 09-13-23

### Bring Your Own Integrations

The goal of this feature is primarily for our own use to more rapidly implement integrations with other RMMs and PSA, but we have opened it up for you to create your own integrations as well.

[https://docs.immy.bot/build-your-own-integration.html](https://docs.immy.bot/build-your-own-integration.html)

### New Parameter New-OAuthConsentParameter

This parameter creates a button that will perform the oauth code authorization flow and allow you to use the response in the script.

[https://docs.immy.bot/scripts.html#parameters](https://docs.immy.bot/scripts.html#parameters)

### Agent Tracking
The Computer -> Agents tab now includes all agents, not just ones used to run scripts. This is preparation for the upcoming computer/tenant offboarding feature. Which will allow us to not only uninstall the agents from the machine but de-provision them from their respective platforms.

###  Metascript WebHooks

You can now receive web requests from within Metascripts.

The webhook URL is *{your-domain}.immy.bot/api/v1/webhooks/{web-hook-id}*, and it accepts Post and Get requests. The webhook id can be retrieved from `$Hook.Id`

An example scenario is this can be used to map Toast buttons to actions in ImmyBot.

```powershell
$Hook = New-ImmyWebHook
$Hook.PublicUri | Add-UriQueryParameter @{
    MyParam = "MyVal"
}
$Hook.PublicUri.ToString()
Write-Host "Waiting for Hook"
$Hook | Wait-ImmyWebHook
Write-Host "Got WebHook!"
```

### Atomic and Cache Cmdlets

Added 3 new Cmdlets, `Set-CacheKeyExpiration` , `Invoke-CommandCached`, and `Invoke-AtomicCommand`

## 0.57.5

Released 08-08-23

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.57.4 where the default value for CW Control's Custom Property Client Name and Secondary Index fields had the wrong values
- Fixed an issue with new instances having a disabled / non-working ImmyBot integration

## 0.57.4

Released 08-07-23

### Improvements

- Started work on improving performance of computer and tenant deletions.  More improvements to come.
- In the global script editor, scripts with param blocks will now only have the parameters auto-binded when the script has been newly opened instead of when it was focused.
- Fixed a bug where `undefined` would sometimes show up as an error in the global script editor output.
- Eliminated 2-step Verify/Create on Integrations
- Updated the error message you get when you attempt to create a deployment for software that does not have a version to deploy. "There are no available versions for this software. The software must have a static version, a dynamic version script, or be linked to software from an alternate provider such as Ninite or Chocolatey in order to be installed."
- Made `New-Parameter -Position` nullable and not default to 0 to prevent parameter binding error "Cannot bind positional parameters because no names were given."
- The ephemeral agent exe now has the correct version where before it would always have 0.0.1
- Moved Remote Control feature to the top of the Preference Page for better visibility
- Package Analyzer will fallback to use `FileVersion` if `ProductVersion` is missing on EXE installers.
- Package Analyzer will now return relative path to installer nested multiple directories inside of a ZIP archive.
For example, a package bundled like `(MyInstallerPackage.zip) => [MyInstallerPackage] -> [InnerFolder] -> Setup.exe`  will return `InnerFolder\Setup.exe` as the FileName instead of `Setup.exe`
- Package Analyzer will now fallback to a list of known-good DNS servers for downloading binary. This should help alleviate issues for a few customers where Azure's default DNS fails to resolve the address. Errors stemming from downloading issues will additionally contain a DNS Audit trail.
Package Analyzer download speed has been improved by up to 50%, reducing time waiting for analysis.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a `NullReferenceException` when no response was received from `InvokeCWARestMethod`
- Fixes an issue where the computer was not showing the active session tag for all computers that had one
- Fixed an issue where Cloud Tasks were failing because pre-flight script were trying to run
- Remote Control: Fixed an issue where some special characters would cause "Type Clipboard" function to fail.
- Fixed a bug with Package Analyzer which caused it to fail to analyze some installers where the server inappropriately  returned a quoted filename.
- Fixed an issue with Package Analyzer failing to extrapolate filename (if one wasn't provided) from the download URL if the server didn't return a `content-disposition` header.

### Agent Delivery - Whitelist **cdn.immy.bot**

Make sure to whitelist cdn.immy.bot in your endpoint protection tools.

The ImmyBot Agent and the Ephemeral Agent are now served from a Cloudflare CDN at https://cdn.immy.bot

### ImmyBot Remote Control (Remotely) - BETA

Initial support for remote control is here!

The newest version of the ImmyBot Agent will support the ability to establish remote control sessions.

Remote control can be established by clicking the "Open Remote Session" dropdown and then clicking the "ImmyBot Agent" option.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/96fe75cd-c059-46ce-ad2b-ca040e7e04c1)

You can also select the initial Windows session within which to start remote control.

### Task Deprecation & Supersedence

Old tasks can now be deprecated in favor of newer tasks.

You can deprecate a task by supply a "Superseded By" task on the task form. You can additionally supply a parameter migration script
that will migrate the parameters specified by the deprecated deployment to the parameters of the superseding one.

### Schedule using the computer's timezone and Active Hours

The schedule details page has been cleaned up and re-organized for easier understanding.

We are introducing two new ways to schedule execution against a computer.

1) Use the computer's timezone for execution

    A common complaint is that it is hard to schedule maintenance for a group of computers that are all in different timezones. Another complaint is that scheduling maintenance against laptops for people who travel is difficult because they are constantly changing timezones.

    You now have the option to schedule maintenance at a particular time according to the timezone specified by the computer.

2) Start execution after active hours if available

    For computers that are running Windows 10+, you can opt into using the Active Hours specified by the computer instead of executing at the specified time on the schedule.

    For now, if active hours are used, execution will be scheduled in the middle of non-active hours.  e.g. If active hours ends at 1pm and starts again at 10pm, we will schedule execution at 5pm.

### Active Hours as Business Hours

When active hours are used to schedule maintenance for a computer, checks against business hours will resolve to active hours.  This is necessary because we don't want to accidentally reboot the computer when in use, when "Suppress Reboots During Business Hours" is checked on the schedule.

Both "Use computer's timezone for execution", and "Start execution after active hours if available" are available for use on the deployment details page as well.

### Pending Ephemeral Agent Session Status

A new session status has been added called Pending Ephemeral Agent Session.

Anytime during a maintenance session, if we fail to establish an ephemeral agent, the session will go into Pending Ephemeral Agent Session. The action it was performing when the failure occurred will not be failed so that it can resume when the ephemeral agent is finally connected.  A background service will continually attempt to establish an ephemeral agent on sessions that are marked with this status.

With this change, we were able to remove the Script Execution Circuit Breaker that has not proved to be very useful.

### Terminating Exceptions

System scripts will now throw terminating exceptions if we fail to establish an ephemeral agent or an actual terminating exception was thrown in the script.

Metascripts will also now throw terminating exceptions when an ephemeral agent fails to establish when using `Invoke-ImmyCommand`.  You must now explicitly use a `try/catch` in order to prevent the terminating exception from ending the script.

This behavior will prevent software and tasks from continuing script execution in the event of a terminating exception, which will prevent false-positive results and report better errors.

#### User Script Terminating Exceptions

When running `Invoke-ImmyCommand -Context "User"`, an additional parameter will be available called `TerminateFromNoLoggedOnUser`.  When set, the script with throw a terminating exception when there is no logged on user. By default, user scripts will not throw a terminating exception when there is no logged on user.

### Made pending-connectivity session triggering more robust

- Removed some event handling from pending connectivity service since the session finished event is not emitted in all circumstances
- Reduced different entrypoints to starting a session to improve consistency and reliability
- Added logic to check for and start the first pending connectivity session in the queue when any session finishes (both pass and fail) directly from the Immy Service Job

### Session Preflight Scripts
A new script category has been added called "Preflight". Preflight scripts run after an ephemeral agent is established and before we attempt to run any other script against a computer.  If the preflight scripts do not return any exceptions, then preflight is consider "passed" and scripts can be executed as normal.  Otherwise, if any preflight script fails, script execution will not be allowed against a computer.

The major reason we added preflight scripts was to detect whether a computer is currently applying windows updates.  Agents can report online and connected while windows updates are applying. However, it's possible that certain actions will not perform successfully while the computer is applying those updates. If we attempt to start or resume a session while windows updates are applying, we run the risk of rebooting the computer during an update and potentially bricking it.

The first global preflight script that has been added will check if the computer is currently applying windows updates and will throw an exception if it is, preventing script execution on the computer until windows updates are completed.

#### Pending Preflight Session Status

A new session status has been added called "Pending Preflight".  When a preflight script fails during a session, the session will go into "Pending Preflight". The action that was actively being performed when the preflight script failed will not failed so that it can be resumed when the computer passes preflight.  A background service will continually attempt to run preflight against a computer until it passes.  Once preflight passes, the session will continue.

### Built-In ImmyBot Agent Software

Before 0.57.0, we had hardcoded an action to perform the ImmyBot Agent update, which resulted in a lot of failures.

The built-in agent update now utilizes the ImmyBot Agent software located in the global repository.

#### Before

### Prepared removal of Azure IotHub for the ImmyBot Agent

The 0.57.0 ImmyBot agent introduces a new method of establishing a connection to the backend using WebSockets.

With this approach, we will be able to remove dependency upon the Azure IoT Hub and provide a more reliable connection to devices.

### Other Improvements

- Added license icons on computers to indicate which ones are actively being counted towards the license count for the month.
- For instances on Immy Standard, we added a checkbox on the computer list page that allows you to filter to only computers that are licensed
- Added fallback for tls when using `Download-FileToFolder`
- The .dlls extracted from the ImmyBot Agent and Ephemeral Agent executable are now signed, which should make whitelisting by our certificate in A/V tools easier.

- Renamed Get-Hash to Get-KeyedHash as it only supported keyed hashes like HMACMD5, HMACSHA1, HMACSHA256, HMACSHA384, and HMACSHA512
- Implemented Get-Hash for non-Keyed algorithms like MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512
- The "Update agent on device" button under the Agents Tab -> ImmyBot agent is clickable even when the computer is offline.  It will put the session in pending connectivity and update when the computer comes back online.
- For ImmyBot Agents version 0.57.0 and above, the version is now displayed on the Agents tab.
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\ImmyBot\Immybot.Agent.exe` now contains the correct file version

- Fixed a potential bug that could occur when script-output recovery would happen, that would cause a false `Recovery is not possible` error to be thrown.
- Fixed issue where running a User-context script w/o a logged on user would cause
`throw $args[0]; # If you can see this, report it to the ImmyBot Dev Team.` to be displayed in powershell output.
- Fixed an issue with Update If Found deployments for software with a test script incorrectly running the test script even when the software was not found
- Fixed some theme color issues with table column choosers and filters

- Fixed an issue where duplicating a task would not copy over all data
- Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented the onboarding task forms from loading
- Fixed an issue where scripts with the category "Filter Script Deployment Target" and "Metascript Deployment Target" were not automatically selecting the correct execution context
- Fixed an issue where some actions would have incorrect parameters or variables when multiple sessions executed the script at the same time

## 0.56.3

Released 2023-05-04

### Improvements
- Added a note to the ImmyBot Agent installer modal indicating that there's an issue on Windows 11 22h2 builds that prevent the PPKG from working and added notes on how to resolve it.

### Bug Fixes
- Added missed user auditing to certain software, task, and deployment operations
- Fixed an issue with assigning tags while creating a new tenant
- Fixed an issue where schedules targeting a specific maintenance item were picking up onboarding only deployments

## 0.56.2

Released 2023-04-27

### Improvements

- Updated the alert on the schedule details page when targeting a specific item to state, "Metascript deployment targets are not supported when the schedule is limited to a specific maintenance item because it would require executing a script against every computer in the system."
- Azure User Sync now excludes external users
- Renamed the "All" tab to "Active" on the computer list page to avoid confusion.  "All" implies it should contain "Pending" agents, which it does not.

### Bug Fixes

### Improvements

- When an agent is identified to a computer that already exists in ImmyBot, we will now automatically select the "Wiped" option if the computer name and OS install date reported by the agent are different than what is reported by the existing computer.
- The ephemeral agent no longer extracts to c:/windows/temp.  This alleviates issues around A/V blocking .dlls coming from the temp directory, and also alleviates issues around windows randomly removing required .dlls for the ephemeral agent to run.
- Updated the identification log text that explains why a manual decision is required
- Added the manufacturer name and serial number of an agent in the agent identification logs when resolving a trusted manufacturer
- Added ability to group by target on the deployment list

- Fixed a bug where alternate providers were not getting disabled when dynamic versions are selected
- Fixed an internal issue where Immy Support Technicians were not allowed access due to existing expired access requests
- Fixed an issue where a pending agent that has the same trusted manufacturer and serial number as an existing computer would sometimes require a manual decision instead of automatically replacing the existing agent

## 0.56.0

Released 2023-04-17

### Tenant and Person tags

Support has been added for Person and Tenant tags.

A tag no longer has a "type".  A tag can be assigned to any person, computer, or tenant.

Deploying a software or maintenance task with a tag target type now resolves computers for the following:

1) computers that have the tag
2) computers for tenants that have the tag
3) primary computers for people who have the tag

Deploying a cloud task can now target tags assigned to tenants, as well as integrations that support client groups.

Now that tags can target tenants, you can create a schedule that targets tags to run a single schedule across multiple tenants.

Tags for tenants can be assigned on the tenant list and tenant details pages.

Tags for persons can be assigned on the person list and person details pages.
### ImmyBot Session Support Requests

You can now request support from Immy technicians from maintenance sessions. When requesting support, you can:

- Add details about the issue you are experiencing
- Select whether an Immy technician should be allowed to access your instance
  - If selected, there is no need to approve an access request for the Immy tech to log into your instance
  - You can disable Immy technician access at any time from the Application Preferences page
- Select whether the session's logs and computer timeline events should be available in the support ticket
  - The logs / timeline events are formatted as a text file and stored in your instance's blob storage account, and a link to download this file is added to the support ticket
  - You can also download this file before submitting the ticket
### Global Script Editor

Below are some of the new features in the script editor!

- General VS Code "vibe"
- Open/Close multiple scripts(tabs)
- Go To Definition support for function scripts
- Script Search and Directory Views with result highlighting
- Variable preview based on script execution context, category, and a selected target (computer, tenant, task, software).
- Parameter Form for scripts with param blocks, selected software that have configuration tasks, and selected maintenance tasks that have parameters
- Closing a script tab with unsaved changes alerts you
- Function name/definition view that shows the results of `Get-Help {functionName} -Detailed | Out-String`
- Basic hotkey support

### Parameter Value View

Sometimes deployment parameters result in an exception when performing the binding.  This can happens when the parameter types have been updated but the values have not.

You can now toggle the parameter form to a value view that provides you the ability to remove/reset values that may be causing issues.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/6fbe70fc-96b0-42dc-9416-b654c2aa7276)
### Tenant Software

The Tenant Details Page now has a Software tab that displays a grid of software that was detected on endpoint machines and could be matched to software in the global database. The result set is grouped by global software name/ID and sorted descending by total installs (i.e. number of devices that have it installed). Each group has a Deploy button, which will open a new deployment for the software that targets all computers under that tenant.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/fb09bb5c-d6d0-4473-a1e7-60fbede16b02)

### Other Improvements

- On the Deployment List Page, tenants with missing or deleted tenants will show `Tenant no-longer exists` under tenant column and the entire row will be highlighted red.
- The current ImmyBot agent version is now shown on the frontend in the installer modal and in the sidebar's ImmyBot Agent Download box.

- You can now install the ImmyBot Script Editor as a progressive web app.
- Cleaned up some of the error messages returned by integrations
- Fixed issues with tag deployments not getting applied during an onboarding session
- System scripts that use param blocks will now through an error letting users known that param blocks are only available in metascript and cloudscript contexts.

- Added a check for whether the computer is online before attempting to apply windows patches
- Get-Hash now supports HMACMD5, HMACSHA256, HMACSHA384, and HMACSHA512
- Added back session list "Completed" count and filter and removed "All"
- Added internal auditing tables for scripts, software, tasks, and deployments.  The future plan is to expose an audit trail for these objects so you can see who made changes and when they were made, with the ability to revert changes.
- Moved the tenant tag selector to the edit tab. The tags now show inline next to the tenant's name
- Made session log database handler more efficient by breaking large updates into smaller queries
- Reduced likelihood of CW Control Integration failing to sync devices.
- The deployment page no longer hangs when attempting to preview/deploy to a large number of computers
- Improved Package Analyzer to handle improper/malformed `content-disposition` header returned from some file servers, which resulted in a failure to analyze a package.
- Expired users can now be un-expired from the edit user form
- `Wait-ImmyComputer` (and therefor `Restart-ComputerAndWait`) has been improved with a new `RebootWithPollingFallback` option that should help alleviate issues with ImmyBot not detecting when a machine has been rebooted and now back online. This option will periodically poll providers/integrations about machine connectivity status if they haven't reported target machine as online after an expected `WaitForEventTimeout` period.
- You can now define multiple functions in a Module script and import them into other scripts using Import-Module
- Maintenance task get/test can now create child actions during detection using the new cmdlet `Add-ImmyMaintenanceActionChild`

- Fixed an issue where tasks marked to be ignored would show as compliant instead of ignored on the maintenance session's action list
- Resolve potential bug with ImmyAgent causing IoTHub issues
- Fixed browser warnings about using variable names starting with $ or _ in setup()
- `Restart-ComputerAndWait` now will show agent timeline events in correct order
- Fixed issue with gdap customers not showing up when azure permission level is reset from custom to default and custom didn't have correct permissions
- Fixed an issue with media missing the base url
- Fixed an issue where software deployments don't report download failures correctly and will continue on.
- Fixed an issue where quick deploying software would not also deploy the configuration task if it had one
* Fixed $using variables on single line scripts
- Fixed an issue where the cross tenant deployment grooup was not sorted at the top of the deployment list page
* Delete existing UserAffinities when new user is set to prevent reverting to old user

## 0.55.0

Released 2023-02-07

### Stale Computers

A new "Stale" tab has been added to the Computers List page showing devices that have not had a recent agent connection event.
By default, the staleness threshold is 30 days. This value can be configured from the System Preferences page.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/8d9c4bb5-af75-4aa0-992c-74b0340af3db)

This feature can be used to cleanup old computers when you are coming close to the maximum limit for computers.

### Dynamic Maintenance Task Parameters (PowerShell Param Blocks)

Maintenance task parameters can now be defined dynamically using a script's param() and dynamicparam{} block.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/f0a4f734-fbf7-4e7e-adae-5ad3c840d20d)

PowerShell has a robust parameter definition and validation engine. By leveraging it, we give ourselves features like:
* Parameter Sets
* Regex Validation
* Conditional/Dynamic Parameters
* Dynamic Values
* Type enforcement

When deploying Onboarding tasks, you can define which parameters should be visible to the technician, while hiding others or setting their defaults in the Deployment.
![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/9d29e0d1-4101-4eba-816e-7fc1f5e71aed)

### GDAP Support

"GDAP Customer Syncing" option has been added to the Azure settings page. Enabling this option does the following:
   - Adds the *DelegatedAdminRelationship.Read.All* permission to ImmyBot's default app registration, to allow retrieval of your GDAP customers
   - Enables ImmyBot to offer a consent link for each GDAP customer to be synced by ImmyBot

Please see the [GDAP Customer Syncing documentation](https://docs.immy.bot/azure-graph-permissions-setup.html#gdap-customer-syncing) for usage details.

**Important!** If you are using a custom app registration (also known as the CSP App Registration), your app registration must have a Web redirect URI of https://&lt;your-domain&gt;.immy.bot/consent-callback, replacing &lt;your-domain&gt; appropriately. Please see the updated [custom app registration docs](https://docs.immy.bot/azure-graph-permissions-setup.html#create-an-app-registration) for details on how to add the redirect URI

### Other Improvements

- Onboarding only maintenance tasks now have an option to "Ignore during automatic onboarding".  This is useful if you have an installer set to automatically onboard the computer and the task requires data that wasn't able to be provided.
- Improved code around establishing Ephemeral Agent connection & eliminated possible race condition.
- Prepend an "[ImmyBot User]" tag for the username that displays for remote session started from a supported provider.
This makes it clear at a glance who is connected to a machine initiated from an ImmyBot user.
- Removed the need for executing suspicious-looking encoded powershell for N-Central integration which would trigger some AV alerts while also moderately decreasing latency to start ephemeral agent.
- When the Immy Agent fails to update during a maintenance session, it will now retry up to 3 times in case it failed due to a transient error
- You can now assign tags to a computer from its Onboarding form
  - ![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/0c452151-e33b-4f4f-9c5a-2ec21c4670a2)
- When we run a script and to establish an ephemeral agent and detect that there are no online agents, we only wait 5 minutes instead of 30 minutes. For integrations like Automate and N-Central and don't support connectivity changed events, a machine would potentially restart so fast the RMM was unaware, therefore we would wait 30 minutes before realizing the machine was actually online.
- Removed execute and verify progress bars when action is a task monitor, and changed the "detect" progress text to "monitor".
- Added the ability to change a computer's primary user from the overview page.
- Improved performance of computer list page when sorting by Date Created
- Added `-IncludeTags` switch parameter to `Get-ImmyComputer` that includes an array of tags containing the tag id and the tag name
- Added a date input to the dashboard page to optionally return actions that were executed on or after the specified date
- Added basic health check functionality to all integrations that were missing health checks
- Added a test suite for the NCentral integration to run in our build pipeline to help reduce bugs
- Made the main scripts table use server-side pagination to decrease the amount of data initially transferred to the page.  Global scripts are now showing over 3MB combined.
- Added better error messages when we fail to sync users due to permissions issues
- Improved and simplified some internal logic related to permissions in our Metascript cmdlets

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with tag acccess levels not saving the limited tenants selected
- Fixed an issue with metacript exception handling where any error with the category `OperationStopped` was being treated as terminating exception
- Fixed an issue with Uri parameter values being inserted into scripts with type `string` instead of type `Uri`
- Fixed an issue where the software upload analysis result description had the wrong color making it impossible to read
- Fixed issue on the computer list -> pending tab where massive exceptions were not limited to a reasonable height
- Fixed issues with SQL queries timing out early than intended
Fixed a bug that would prevent users from actually using the N-Central integration with servers that are hosted on a non-standard port.
- Fixed an issue where the tenant link on a computer's overview page had a bunch of whitespace that could be accidentally clicked.

## 0.54.5

Released 2022-12-22

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with deleting actions that caused sessions to fail
- Fixed an issue saving some database calls due to issues from the migration to flex database servers
- Fixed an issue with saving scripts that incorrectly fail with a message that the name is not unique

## 0.54.4

Released 2022-12-19

### Improvements

- Added bulk cancel and bulk rerun buttons to the maintenance session list page
Added `Split-Path` cmdlet as well as `$ActionId`, `$SessionId` and `$SessionGroupId` to the included variables
- Improved Ephemeral Agent connection speed

- Centered the text in the "Session #xxx in progress" button
- Fixed an issue with saving the SMTP form
- Fixed an issue where session logs could repeat "Reboots have been suppressed during business hours" over and over

## 0.54.3

Released 2022-11-23

### Improvements

- Improved enqueueing of maintenance sessions based on priority.  Adhoc > Onboarding > Scheduled maintenance
- Removed service bus form options for CW Control as the service bus is now always used
- Added a health check to the CW Control integration to report unhealthy when the extension is not up to date

## 0.54.2

Released 2022-11-17

### Improvements
- Improved our identification de-dupe logic to automatically associate re-installed agents to the correct computers
- Added more identification logs for some edge case scenarios to help with debugging
- Added onboarding text to dashboard underneath onboarding computers
- Slightly improved performance of preview/deploy functionality on the dashboard page

## 0.54.1

Released 2022-11-14

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with CW Control syncs causing CW Control agents to re-sync into ImmyBot unnecessarily

## 0.54.0

Released 2022-11-11

### CW Control Updates

We added support for the breaking changes introduced in CW Control 22.9.
We addressed stability issues with Control crashing due to the ImmyBot extension.  On the Control integration form, make sure you check off the new options for using the Service Bus for better performance.

### Pending Identification Updates

Agent identification now has logging to help you find root causes for why some agents fail to have scripts run against them. View them in Computers -> Pending Identification -> Show Identification Logs

You can also see the identification logs for successfully identified agents under the Computer -> Agents tab.

We now utilize the serial numbers for devices that come from trusted manufacturers (currently Lenovo, Dell, and HP). If a computer already exists in ImmyBot for a trusted manufacturer, any additional agents with that computer's serial number will skip identification and automatically be associated.

### Improvements
- Fixed issue where Intellisense would throw null reference exception when completing variables
- Updated CW Control integration to support CW Control 22.9 (extension version 0.3.0)
- Added immy subscription information to billing details page
- Made subscription portal show within immy frontend instead of a link to chargebee
- Updated the default combined maintenance task script to leverage the latest function scripts in Immy. The new script is `Get-WindowsRegistryValue -Path "HKLM:\Software\Wow6432Node\MySoftwareVendor\MySoftware" -Name EnableFeature | Registry-ShouldBe -Value 1`
- License files are now downloaded before running a configuration task's test script during detection in case the script relies on the presence of the license file
- Added a new tenant preference "Exclude from Cross-Tenant Deployments and Schedules". When a tenant is excluded, all cross-tenant deployments and schedules targeting the tenant or its computers will not be applied when full maintenance is ran. This is particularly useful for Co-Managed IT situations that don't don't want your cross-tenant schedules or deployments.
- Improved startup time of instances in situations where there was a large number of recently added agents
- Added "Change Tenant" in batch actions for the computers table

## 0.53.12

Released 2022-11-09

### Bug Fixes

- Removed the ImmyBot Agent from the Tenant -> Mappings table
- Reduced metric reporter frequency to 30 minutes

## 0.53.11

Released 2022-10-20

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a null reference exception that was occurring when sending the maintenance session follow-up email
- Fixed a potential exception that could occur in the N-Central API
- Fixed an exception that occurred when trying to retrieve the online agents for a computer
- Fixed an uncommon issue where some dynamic version scripts were throwing a null reference exception
- Fixed an uncommon exception with ImmyBot Agent connection events that caused the event to not get saved
- Fixed an issue with syncing devices from CW Automate where it would potentially take a few minutes and block other requests
- Fixed an issue where some CW Control and N-Central agents were not automatically onboarding when they should
- Fixed issue where `Get-ImmyComputer -InventoryKeys` metascript was not auto populating the available keys
- Fixed an issue with incorrect breadcrumbs sometimes showing on the computer list page

## 0.53.10

Released 2022-10-05

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with displaying large software icon sizes on the Library -> Ordering page

## 0.53.9

Released 2022-10-05

### Improvements

- SVGs now render correctly when uploaded as software icons
- Increased some low timeout values on the ephemeral agent that were causing devices with slow network connections to fail
- Changed the Pending Identification tab to default sort descending by Date Added since the most recent machines are the ones we are usually looking for.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with the ImmyBot Agent connected/disconnected events not propagating for pc reboots and pending connectivity sessions
- Reduced likelyhood of `Output CircularBuffer has already over-run requested index` error in scripts
- Ephemeral Agent reconnection is now prevented upon receiving a 500 status code.  This was previously causing agents to stay running indefinitely.
- Fixed an issue on the system update page where the new releases dropdown was not stretching the width like the current release dropdown

## 0.53.8

Released 2022-9-22

### Improvements

- The "Suppress Reboots During Business Hours" flag no longer relies on  offline behavior.  If you are suppressing reboots during business hours and you run a session during business hours, then Immy will suppress reboots.  Business hours are now checked on every script execution, and the `RebootPreference` variable passed to scripts will also be updated to `Suppress` if it was not already set. We did this so that scripts that handle reboots can safely rely on this variable.
- The customer list on the Azure page no longer shows the MSP tenant as a selectable option in the Linked Tenant dropdown since the MSP tenant is mapped by default
- Refactored how we handle ImmyBot agent connected and disconnected events.  Instances that heavily utilize the ImmyBot agent will have significantly improved performance.
- The `Enable Automatic Onboarding` field on the PPKG form is now disabled and shows an alert if the onboarding preference is globally disabled or disabled for the selected tenant.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with loading the AzureAD module for metascripts.  This issue was causing all scripts that relied on AzureAD commands to fail.
- Fixed an issue where syncing the connected state of large numbers of ImmyBot agents would prevent other system jobs from being performed
- Fixed an issue where configuration tasks for already compliant software were executing at the very end of a maintenance session instead of in the expected order
- Fixed an issue where the default upgrade strategy was set to none instead of install over
- Fixed a permission issue where non-admins could not refresh the connectivity status of a computer
- Fixed an issue with downloading the ImmyAgent installer as an `.iso` file where the extension was incorrectly set to `.ppkg`
- Fixed an issue where software set to perform an update would incorrectly report compliant when the software did not specify an upgrade strategy and the upgrade was never performed.  The action will now fail and report "Upgrade failed: No Upgrade Strategy specified on the software."
- Fixed an issue with maintenance action execution ordering. If the currently executing action has dependencies, it will now immediately execute the dependencies instead of waiting until the end of the session.
- Fixed an issue with selecting a license on the deployment details page where the selected license was not shown upon refreshing

## 0.53.7

Released 2022-09-14

### Improvements

- Increased the timeout of the Ephemeral Agent's Ping RPC method from 1 second to 5 seconds.  1 second was too short and was unnecessarily causing scripts to fail on machines with high network latency.
- Added a warning message whenever the Ephemeral Agent's Ping RPC method takes over 1 second to respond to help identify machines with high network latency

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with schedules where updating a schedule from a single tenant to cross tenant would delete the schedule. This was happening due to a bug in a database constraint between schedules and tenants.
- Fixed an issue where the connectivity status button on the computer details page was not actually refreshing the agent's connectivity status
- Fixed an issue where repairing a software would trigger full maintenance

## 0.53.6

Released 2022-09-12

### Improvements

- Added `Set-ImmyDeviceId` cmdlet to be used during Inventory to keep the UUID of the machine up to date and prevent new computers from getting created when the UUID of the machine has changed due to a feature update.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the "Determine Desired Version" phase was running before the "Detect Installed Version" phase. "Detect Installed Version" needs to run first so we can pass the detected version to scripts that may rely on it when determining the desired version.
- Fixed an issue where dynamic versions were not properly installing dependent versions

## 0.53.5

Released 2022-09-09

### Bug Fixes

 - Fixed an issue from 0.53.4 where some code changes were unintentionally  included in the release which caused downloading the PPKG to fail

## 0.53.4

Released 2022-09-08

### Improvements

- For maintenance task test scripts, we made Immy tolerant of non-Boolean values by displaying a warning when non-Booleans are found on the pipeline along with helper text for preventing output pollution.
- Updated the ImmyBot Agent to support installing beta versions

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a scripting error that caused Immy to indicate there was no output when there was definitely output

## 0.53.3

Released 2022-08-30

### Software Test Script Changes

We now execute the software test script during the detection stage for software that have updates available.

**Before**, if a software needed to be upgraded, we would not run the software's test script in detection.  We would perform the upgrade and then run the test script afterwards.  However, if the test failed, the action would fail without any remediation.

**Now**, if a software needs to be upgraded, and it has a test script, the test script will run in detection. If the test script fails, then the repair strategy will be performed instead of the upgrade strategy.  The test script will still be run after the upgrade as it did before.

### General Improvements

- Updated the error text for schedule cron expressions to indicate that a schedule can run at most once per day.
- The ImmyBot Agent service sometimes throws an exception about a missing file `CliWrap.dll`, which causes the agent to bork.  When we encounter this exception, we now auto restart the service to resolve the issue.
- Improved the session log message "Detection stage failed: Software Action Id is not specified on the provided configuration task action" to include more information to help diagnose the issue.  It is usually because the deployment contains out-of-date data and needs to be updated.
- Improved the performance of loading the main computer list when sorting by computer name
- Test methods containing multiple outputs now return the result of ANDing those outputs together to compute the overall result.
- Updated Quick Deploy to allow you to choose a desired state. e.g. "Install, Uninstall, Update If Found, Ignore" or "Enforce, Monitor, Audit"
- Added detection of stuck/non-responsive jobs such as the agent identification job, which can initiate a self-restart of backend.
- Added reboot preference dropdown to quick deploy and override forms
- Moved several action columns on tables to the left side for consistency and best compatibility with mobile views.
- Added an option to schedules and adhoc-deplyoments to send detection emails even when all actions are compliant.  This is to allow users whose computers are already up to date to still receive a maintenance email.
- Updated the script list page and session log component to use the Monaco script editor
- Added the CW Automate icon to the main computer list. Clicking the icon opens up the computer in CW Automate.
- Added "Date Added" to the computer list and made it sortable
- Added a simple "new" tag on the computer list for computers that have been added to ImmyBot within the last 24 hours
- Added an 'X' button to easily remove linked tenants from integrations

### Bug Fixes

- After a task is created, the `Runs Against` property is now disabled. Changing this value after it is created can cause issues for deployments that are referencing it.
- Fixed an issue with Ephemeral Agent resilient script output logic that would fail to re-connect if the script had never had any output prior to connection loss. (Ex. SonicWall VPN installer script)
- Added missing triggered by text on the session details page when the session was triggered by a schedule or automatic onboarding
- Fixed a width issue on some dropdown buttons
- Fixed an issue with the integration client list re-sorting after you link/unlink a tenant

## 0.53.2

Released 2022-08-19

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an error that showed on the schedules list when a schedule existed that did not specify a time zone
- Fixed issue introduced in 0.53.1 where the current immy version stopped displaying in the sidebar
- Fixed issue introduced in 0.53.1 where the maintenance item ordering page broke
- Fixed issue introduced in 0.53.1 where showing/adding parameters on the maintenance task page broke
- Fixed an issue where monitor results were only showing the last line of output instead of all output
- Fixed an issue where monitor results were overflowing into other components
- Fixed an issue where re-running actions while showing action details would not displaying logs as they came in
- Fixed an issue introduced for instances that signed up after the release of 0.53.0 where identification would fail due to some missing database configurations

## 0.53.1 (un-published)

Released 2022-08-18

### Improvements
- Added a `Trigger Now` button to the Azure User Sync preference on the preferences page
- Added a description to the PPKG reset windows checkbox - "Will perform a reset of windows with the remove user data option"

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue with agent identification where users were seeing the following error - `Failed attempt to differentiate existing agent and pending agent: 42883: procedure sp_create_computer_from_agent(integer, uuid, boolean, text, text, text, unknown, boolean) does not exist POSITION: 6`
- Updated the alert of the person list page to match the available actions
- Fixed an issue where the software configuration task edit link was missing
- Fixed an issue where the branding logo alt text was still hardcoded to "Immense Networks" instead of the value provided by the branding
- Fixed an issue with cancelling a detection only session from the computer details page -> software tab.

## 0.52.7

Released 2022-07-11

### Improvements


- The script list page now persists your filters after refreshing or leaving the page.
- Fixed width issues in the maintenance item column on the deployment list page
- Reduced required permissions for N-Central integration. See [the new N-Central integration docs](https://docs.immy.bot/ncentral-integration-setup.html) for details
- Added a new PowerShell cmdlet `Stop-ImmySession` that will cancel the maintenance session it is currently running in

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed some potential issues around agent connected/disconnected events
- Fixed potential N-Central exception with re-sending messages
- Fixed potential issue with 'missing' devices from N-Central due to possible filter contamination in N-Central

## 0.52.6

Released 2022-06-27

### Improvements


- Set the default install script for new software to the "Manual Install Script" and the upgrade strategy to "Install Over" whenever we don't have another specific install script to provide
- Set the default software installer type to "Installer File"
- Updated the example New-DynamicVersion script
- We now show a confirmation modal when choosing the "Wiped" option for resolving an agent identification conflict.
- You can now see Cloud Sessions from the main Sessions list!
- Added warnings when the ephemeral agent is failing to establish a connection to help users identify causes for failing script execution
- Fixed an issue with the detection stage stuck running when it fails to execute scripts in the beginning of the stage
- Improved timeline connected/disconnected events. There were edge cases that would show multiple connects/disconnects back to back.
- Removed timeline computer online/offline events to avoid confusion. These events were never actually based on a computer coming online or going offline. We simply emitted "online" when an agent connected and happened to be the only online agent. Similarly for "offline" events, we only emitted the event when an agent disconnected and all agents were offline. ImmyBot does not actively check whether a machine is online or offline. It only checks whether it has any connected agents to use. This concept will be further improved upon to help resolve issues with agents incorrectly reporting connected/disconnected.
- Removed link to software/task on deployment list since people are clicking it thinking it is the edit deployment link
- Moved the software/task selector back above the target selector on the deployment edit page
- Removed the media nav item since it's not actually useful

### Bug Fixes


- Moved "Update If Found" from underneath "Installed" to the same level as "Installed" for clarity. A software can be "installed, uninstalled, ignored, or updated if found"
- Fixed an issue with cloud task previews failing with "device offline"
- Fixed an issue where the ImmyBot agent update action would not run when the agent was offline
- Fixed an issue with the agent updates stage, onboarding stage, and resolution stage not honoring pending connectivity
- Fixed an issue where the resume and cancel session buttons were incorrectly showing for postponed sessions
- Fixed an issue with CW Control and CW Automate health error messages excluding important details that can help diagnose the problem
- Fixed an issue where we were not checking if a configuration task is actually marked as a configuration task. This resulted in tasks getting run when they should not have.

## 0.52.5

Released 2022-06-13

### N-Central Beta Updates


- Fixed an issue with exceptions that may occur inside the N-Central device-sync job causing memory to bloat
- You can now get registration tokens from the NCentral integration via new PSCmdlet `Get-NCentralRegistrationToken`

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/501dd3bc-d823-40a0-a307-000ec5185e6a)

### Other Improvements


- Under "Preferences", the description of the User Affinity Sync feature says it will run every 4 hours; this is incorrect. Verbiage was changed to indicate it will run every 24 hours.
- On the integration details page, a confirmation modal has been added when clicking the "Bulk create tenants..." button to prepare users that this will cause code execution for linked clients.
- Added more improvements to online/offline agent handling during maintenance sessions
- Updated the online/offline event receiver for CW Control to return immediately in an effort to close requests faster

## 0.52.4

Released 2022-05-31

### Improvements


- Removed unnecessary checkboxes from the Computers table on the "Edit Schedule" page
- Immy live chat now supports screenshare! Immy support can now request access to view your screen to help resolve issues faster.

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed an issue with the maintenance email actions requiring authentication

## 0.52.3

Released 2022-05-27

### Improvements


- ImmyAgents no longer need to see a valid board serial number in order to complete registration or rekey. Instead, ImmyAgent may fall back on and rely on an 'ImmyHWID' (Immy hardware id), when a board serial is not available. ImmyHWIDs are derived from CPU, BIOS, MOBO, GPU, and TPM information where available.
- Updated maintenance sessions to listen on agent connected/disconnected events instead of computer online/offline events which have faster responses and higher success rates
- When a new agent comes into ImmyBot, we now kick off the identification job immediately if it isn't already running in an effort to speed up identification
- Added session logs for dependencies indicating what they are for. e.g. `Software A depends on Software B â†’ If not installed then install`.
- The actions in the maintenance email (Reboot Now, Update Now, and Postpone), now link to a form on the ImmyBot instance instead of linking directly to the backend api. The reason for this is because some spam filters will automatically follow links in an email, which has accidentally caused computer reboots. Moving the link to a form allows spam filters to no longer be able to trigger the action automatically.

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed an issue causing the computer details page to sometimes not load
- Fixed an issue with the ImmyAgent rekey request not being received
- Fixed an issue where `Get-ImmyComputer` was incorrectly reporting offline
- Fixed an issue where configuration file parameters were not being downloaded when the configuration task did not have any enabled scripts
- Fixed an issue with displaying the dependency badges on maintenance actions
- Fixed an issue with the schedule's day of week selector cutting off the last characters of "Wednesday"
- Fixed an issue with the CompareTo-ImmyBotVersion metascript
- Fixed an issue with some maintenance action start times showing "2021 years ago" instead of "Unavailable" when the action never started
- Bump Azure IoTHub packages to resolve some connection issues with the ImmyAgent

## 0.52.2

Released 2022-05-25

### Ephemeral Agent and Identification Improvements


- **ALL** scripts now run through the ephemeral agent, even during identification and computer de-dupe logic ðŸŽ‰
- Additional exception information is now visible in Identification Failed tab, and in session output. This furthers insight for users to understand and fix potential reasons why the providers may have failed to run our agent.
  ![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/22b9d763-3a43-4403-8c01-70e020e3a303)
- Fixed an issue where the date was not being set correctly when adding a AgentIdentificationFailure log, leading the user to think this issue happened at the beginning of time!

### Other Improvements


- Added computer batch actions button on the tenants -> tenant details -> computers tab
- You can no longer create a schedule that executes within one hour of detection. This is a safety measure to help prevent reboots during business hours
- Added a checked to the schedules page for "Execute maintenance immediately after detection" to make it easier for those that do actually want to run execution after detection. When checked, you cannot set the execution time.
- The schedule list "Next Run" column now sorts correctly and also shows the browser's local "Next Run" time
- Added clarity to session logs when we are checking if an agent is online
- Quick deploy actions now use Offline Behavior: Apply on Connect
- Auto onboarding sessions now use Offline Behavior: Apply on Connect

## 0.52.0

Released 2022-05-18

### Tags


You can now add tags to computers, and deploy software to tags! Manage tags under the settings link on the sidebar. Tags help in scenarios where workstations are shared by a variety of users and there is otherwise not a common property to target with a filter script.

Tags can be added to computers as a batch action on the computer list page.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/ac94e766-2362-48b0-936d-17a901aea82c)

### Immy Chat Integration


_Added in 0.51.5_

We added LiveChat to Immy to make it easier for you to get support

### Session Script Execution Improvements


Before executing a script on a device, we now check if it is online. If it is not online, we verify whether any of its agents are incorrectly reporting online and refresh the status appropriately. If it is still not online, we will wait up to 30 minutes for it come back online. If it is still not online, then we will mark the session as Pending Connectivity (only for Apply On Connect) or cancel the session due to the computer being offline.

### Other Improvements

- The checked parameters will show on the computer onboarding form, allowing the user to override the value just for the onboarding session

  ![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/1e37389e-827a-4ec3-a9d6-20e141dcfd59)

### Other Improvements


- Implemented a Get-Hash cmdlet in the Metascript engine useful for interacting with APIs like NinjaRMM and Mimecast that require HMACSHA1 signatures
- We moved the Target Selector above the Software / Task Selector on the deployment page since it felt more natural to answer "Who am I creating a deployment for?" before answering "What am I creating a deployment for?"
- Software Display Name Regex detection now supports capture groups to pull the version

  ![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/60a6c664-4047-42b1-9966-0c8566713670)

## 0.50.8

Released 2022-03-04

### Onboarding Deployments


The **Onboarding** target type has been moved to a separate checkbox so that you can limit deployments to onboarding only AND use the target type filters.

### ImmyAgent Improvements


Updated internal infrastructure to utilize our new [extended verification code-signing certificate](https://www.digicert.com/signing/code-signing-certificates#EV-Code-Signing).

We currently sign:

1. ImmyAgent executable & MSI/EXE/PPKG Installers
2. Ephemeral Agent executable
3. Static PoSH run on computers

In addition to being more secure, this ensures our software is no-longer flagged by SmartScreen.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Customers utilizing software such as ThreatLocker _MUST_ ensure our new certificate is whitelisted, as our new EV cert required "LLC" to be present on our CN and O.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/40220de1-d9f9-48fb-a39e-ebb791bd19fe)

### Bug Fixes


- Improved exception handling during maintenance sessions
- Fixed an issue with re-running cloud scripts from a session log where it would throw an exception
- Fixed some performance issues and improved caching of function scripts

## 0.50.7

Released 2022-02-25

### Maintenance Task Serial Execution


A maintenance task now has the option to "Execute Serially".

When checked, this maintenance task is guaranteed to only have one instance active at a time.

e.g. If three maintenance sessions have an action for a maintenance task that executes serially, then one session will execute the maintenance task while the other two wait for it to complete. Once the first completes, the second will execute. Once the second completes, the third will execute.

This is useful for maintenance tasks that rely on the state of subsequent executions.

### Other Improvements


- Added a `Status` and `Types` column to the CW Manage client list on the integration details page so you can easily filter your list to clients you want to create tenants for. Also made the `Linked Tenants` column filterable to "Linked" or "Not linked". The `Bulk create tenants for unassigned clients` is now `Bulk create tenants for filtered unassigned clients` and will only bulk create tenants for those visible rows matching the table filters.
- Added checks to ensure that the identification job is running properly

## 0.49.0

Released 2022-01-11

### Improved Performance


In this release, codenamed "Cheetah" we achieved a **20x** improvement in script execution performance through the use of WebSockets, Named Pipes, and removing code that is no longer necessary since the introduction of the Ephemeral Agent.

We also made restarting machines faster by using the new event driven Wait-ImmyComputer cmdlet when waiting for computers to reconnect after a reboot.

### Apply on Connect


#### Problem to solve

Computers that are offline never receive maintenance. These computers need a way to update when they miss their maintenance window.

#### Solution

You can now specify the offline behavior for computers on schedules and ad-hoc deployments.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/a720eb9f-74b7-4a9d-935e-4fb0cbe6ace1)

When offline behavior is set to `Apply On Connect`, a session will get marked as ![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/5df28983-4e9d-455c-b1b3-21a8638b6e6a) when the device is offline. When the device comes online, the session will resume.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/e6b38fd2-0370-4e09-b75d-527867cfeedd)

Since devices can come online at anytime, the option to `Suppress Reboots During Business Hours` is checked by default.

If a device is offline before the detection stage, then it will run the detection stage when it comes online.

If a device is offline before the execution stage, then it will only run the execution stage when it comes online. It will not re-run detection.

Maintenance emails are only sent out once regardless if the device goes offline.

### Timeline


On the computer details overview tab, there is now a section called Timeline that
shows particular events that have occurred for the computer.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/90b4b265-8744-44cb-b3ce-47c2bd6ec0e0)

The events we are currently showing are:

1. Agent disconnected
1. Agent connected
1. Maintenance action started (only shows if the action required execution)
1. Maintenance action completed (only shows if the action required execution)

More events will be added in the future.

### Other Improvements


- Improved performance of determining desired state of deployments during maintenance
- Improved performance of some update queries
- Added a new metascript cmdlet `Wait-ImmyComputer` that returns as soon as a computer has connectivity
- Added & Updated Ephemeral Agent connection statistics in 'System Status' page to report data/data-rate metrics about the underlying Ephemeral Agent connection to the backend

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed an issue where software download scripts were timing out after 60 seconds if the script didn't specify its own timeout
- Fixed an issue where changes made to a configuration task parameters from the software page were not saving
- Fixed issues displaying incorrect text in the target type column on the deployment and schedule list pages
- Fixed a bug where you could not remove a software download script
- Fixed a bug with `Add-UriQueryParameter` where it did not accept array values or parse existing parameters

- Fixed a bug where dynamic versions could depend on itself and cause an infinite loop

## 0.48.7

Released 2021-12-10

### Access Requests


Your users and the ImmyBot support team can now request access to your instance! When an unauthorized person authenticates, a "Request Access" button is available that will submit an access request. An MSP user can then grant or deny access from the user list page. An expiration of one hour, one day, or never can be set for the user.

The access request feature can be enabled/disabled on the preferences page.

- Improved the readability of the Azure page
- Added an alert to the user page about creating new users
- Replaced references to "Immybot" with "ImmyBot"

## 0.48.0

Released 2021-11-29

### IMPORTANT


#### **The changes in this release will require reconsent at first login!**

**â“˜ If your Azure AD is configured to not allow non-Admin users to consent to new apps, you will need to login once as a user with sufficient privileges.**

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/4aebeec7-2bcf-414f-952e-272e3deaffc5)

- Consolidated backend and frontend into a single Enterprise Application (Service Principal)
- Removed `backend.subdomain.immy.bot` and pointed all API calls to `subdomain.immy.bot`
  - This has the additional benefit of increasing performance as the browser no longer makes a CORS pre-flight check when hitting the API
    - Note: If you are using the ImmyBot API, you will need to remove `backend.` from your URI

## 0.47.12

Released 2021-11-29

### Bug Fixes

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed issue where Ephemeral Agent EXE failed to launch due to an extraction issue on Windows Server Core

## 0.47.9

Released 2021-11-22

### Bug Fixes


1. Fixed an issue with inventory and script-run cancellation logic causing high memory usage
1. Fixed an issue with function scripts being used in metascripts causing heavy load on global database
1. Switched to force Ephemeral Agent EXE to utilize System Proxy settings to alleviate connection refusal for some users
1. Fixed an issue with PowerShell execution occasionally throwing an error that would crash ImmyBot

## 0.47.8

Released 2021-11-17

### Features

#### Ephemeral Agent EXE

1. The ephemeral agent now executes as an `.exe` instead of a PowerShell script.
1. This allows us to use a WebSocket instead of polling, which improves performance and resiliency as we can immediately detect disconnections.
1. Decreased initial connection time by attempting to connect using all RMMs simultaneously instead of in sequence.
1. Substantially improved logging to help troubleshoot script execution issues

**Note: You may have to exclude your instance's hostname in the firewall from SSL Inspection policies! SSL Inspection may interfere with the WebSocket connection from this new agent!**

**Note: You may also need to adjust your security software to allow the EXE to execute. We recommend adding an exclusion for the Immense Networks code signing certificate as it will be used to sign all ImmyBot PowerShell scripts and Executables.**

The subject of the certificate is:

```
CN=Immense Networks, O=Immense Networks, L=Baton Rouge, S=Louisiana, C=US
```

### Improvements

- Inventory scripts now run in parallel
- ImmyBot will always overwrite license files to prevent issues with software not activating because the previous license file is still in the ImmyBot download folder.
- The script terminal on the computer details page is no longer cleared when swapping between tabs.
- Updated the instance disabled text to specify that only an admin user can re-enable immy

### Bug Fixes

- The EXE ephemeral agent addresses intermittent ScriptTimeout exceptions that would occur for a variety of reasons
- Implemented a "Script Execution Circuit Breaker" per computer to prevent RMM overload when retrying ephemeral connections (This can happen when security software blocks execution or firewalls prevent outbound connections)
- Fixed several issues around script error handling. Line numbers now display correctly. Exceptions that occur before running a script are now caught and displayed properly.
- Fixed an issue where inventory output with a value of `null` was being treated as successful and overwriting good results
- Fixed a bug with session logs showing null references when a script was cancelled or timed out
- Fixed a bug with quick deploy where the deployment resolution stage was unnecessarily reaching out to the computer to retrieve its software
- Fixed a bug during maintenance sessions, `Field at index '1' does not exist...`, where retrieving the list of installed chocolatey software would fail
- Resolved a potential issue around re-acquiring ephemeral agent sessions under concurrent script execution scenarios
- Fixed a bug when re-authenticating to ImmyBot where you wouldn't be redirected to the page you were previously on due to the URL not including query parameters

## 0.47.0

Released 2021-10-28

### Maintenance Execution Order


You can now specify the order in which maintenance items are executed by navigating to "/deployments/ordering" or by clicking the "Ordering" link in the side nav bar under "Deployments".

![Maintenance Execution Order](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/itemorderingscreenshot.png)

### Other Improvements


- Made the software, maintenance task, script, and media list pages default to showing "All" for convenience. Additionally made small changes to these pages to make them more consistent in their appearance.

- Refactored some code to be platform agnostic in preparation for hosting ImmyBot in Linux instead of Windows
- Made some internal improvements to how we store core PowerShell code that will make development and script signing easier
- Allowed dynamic version software to use the "Update If Found" desired state
- Allowed inventory to use metascripts
- Parallelized inventory to run up to 4 scripts in parallel for faster execution
- When creating scripts from a software or maintenance task, the script name will now have a default value. E.g. If creating a new installation script the default name will be " Installation Script" made in this MR for use in release notes
- Added a maintenance item column to the schedule list page
- Simplified the "Getting Started Wizard"
- Removed unnecessary padding in the "Getting Started Wizard"
- New instances will now automatically approve all recommended target assignments

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed command-line scripts so uninstall logic works as expected
- Updated the target assignment resolution to exclude assignments that are tied to disabled provider links
- Fixed a bug where the test script on a software was not getting called if the software was detected
- Fixed a bug with maintenance item ordering where the preferred initial order of recommended items was not being set
- Fixed an issue that was causing a memory leak that scaled with the number of ImmyBot agent installers

## 0.46.9

Released 2021-10-04

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug with running user context scripts where an error was being swallowed and the scripts would inevitably time out
- Fixed an issue with updating the "Installer Executable Path / Installer File" field on the software version form where it would revert to the previous value
- Fixed a bug where software marked as "Download Only" would attempt to run its configuration task. Software that is set to download only no longer adds an action for its configuration task.
- Fixed an issue that was causing the azure user sync to stop running. When it encounters an issue syncing a specific tenant, it will now log some details that will help the immy team determine why it is failing and then continue attempting to sync other tenants.
- Fixed a bug with running `Get-AgentInstallScript` where it would return the error `Tenant # is not linked to a client for the specified provider`
- Fixed a bug saving the onboarding form where we were not disabling the onboarding save buttons while the page was still loading. Attempting to to save before the page was loaded was causing an error to be thrown
- Fixed a bug where the branding list was showing brandings as "Expired" when they actually weren't
- Fixed a bug where updating brandings with no selected tenant would cause the branding to get deleted instead
- Fixed a bug where using the "Re-inventory" button on the computer details page would often time out and show an error
- Fixed a bug where the edit deployment page always showed the desired version: latest

- Removed "Powered by Immense Networks" from the footer of maintenance emails
- Fixed a bug where after uploading and analyzing software, the analyzed upgrade code was not executing the search to see if it was found on existing machines
- Fixed a bug on the computer list page where a computer's online status was considering disabled links. Since a disabled link can result in stale data, we no longer use them to determine the online status of a computer.
- Fixed a bug with clicking the "Delete Offline Agent" button on the computer agents tab
- Fixed a bug where default configuration task parameters were missing when deploying from the computer software tab
- Fixed a null reference exception that was occurring when attempting to run a script against an offline computer
- Fixed an issue with saving computers from the onboarding screen where it would fail when the computer had an automate agent
- Fixed script reference counts for dynamic version scripts, download installer scripts, and all default software scripts
- Fixed a bug with assigning a local download installer script to a local software

## 0.46.4

Released 2021-09-16

- Updated sandbox identification to preserve maintenance session data instead of deleting old data since that data could still be useful for debugging

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed a bug in deserializing data that resulted in `The requested operation requires an element of type 'Number', but the target element has type 'String'.`
- Fixed a potential null reference exception when retrieving bulk software
- Fixed a bug with session logs not showing the correct end date time

## 0.46.2

Released 2021-09-15

### Improvements


- Changed ImmyAgent to use callbacks internally to response to Ephemeral Agent script start events. This should improve issues where the Ephemeral Agent doesn't start when using the ImmyAgent
- Added a new switch parameter to `Invoke-ImmyCommand` called `-IncludeLocals`, which will automatically include all variables from the metascript runspace. When using `-IncludeLocals` you no longer need to specify $using variables.

## 0.46.1

Released 2021-09-14

### Bug Fixes

## 0.46.0

Released 2021-09-14

### Ephemeral Agent Script Execution


ImmyBot now uses "Ephemeral Agents" for script execution.

This new method will normalize the time it takes to run scripts across all RMM Providers. The initial payload to start the ephemeral agent will be sent through the RMM, but then all subsequent scripts will communicate directly with the ephemeral agent.

An Ephemeral Agent is a lightweight PowerShell script that establishes a direct connection with the ImmyBot backend via Polling or SSE (Server-Sent Events) to receive script payloads to execute. Script output is then sent through an Azure Service Bus for high throughput handling. The ImmyBot backend manages the lifetime of ephemeral agents and is able to re-use them efficiently.

### Script Path Preference


It is now easier to whitelist ImmyBot in your Antivirus. The Ephemeral Agent will use a script path containing a hash unique to your instance that you can rekey yourself.

### Default Software Scripts


You can now specify install, uninstall, post-install, post-uninstall, upgrade, and test scripts directly on the software.

This reduces duplication for software where the versions use the same exact scripts while also making software easier to manage.

**Considerations**

1. If the software has a script and the desired version has a script, then the script on the version takes precedence. (e.g. the version's install script will be used instead of the software's install script if both are present)
1. If the version does not have a script, then we will attempt to use the one on the software if the script is present.

### Custom Download Script


You can now assign a "Download Installer" script to software that will be used instead of the core Immy download installer logic. This is valuable when downloading 3rd party installers from URLs that require authentication or specific headers.

### Other Improvements


- Combined RMM Links and PSA Links into a single Integrations page under Settings
- Improved Tarma InstallMate package analyzer detection
- Added documentation for Ephemeral Agent & ServiceBus Script-Result handler info tiles in System Status page to better explain what they mean, and how to discern specific pieces of information from them

## 0.44.0

Released 2021-06-28

### Quick Deploy


Deploying software for a specific computer is now easier. Located at the top of the Software tab on the computer details page. Tell your techs to use this form if they need to deploy software to a specific computer.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/c70b0628-847b-40b6-99db-456f69ce5115)

After selecting a software / maintenance task that you want to deploy, a session will be kicked off to determine if the computer has any applicable deployments. If a deployment is found, then you'll be presented actions for that deployment.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/87d9a5a0-0f1d-41ea-94ba-8868fbe674f5)

If a deployment is not found, then you are asked if you would like to create one.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/e268d0b8-2538-4019-bbe3-492468f162d8)

If the selected item requires configuration task parameter values or a license, then you still need to create the deployment from the traditional deployment page. We plan on expanding on this to allow supplying a license and parameters directly on this form.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/f351d75d-738e-4acb-9588-3103842fcda4)

### Computer List Search Improvements


Searching for computers is now much faster after some internal refactoring of how the data was stored. We removed the need to select a filter so you can now search by any of the available fields specified in the placeholder.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/ae56632e-651a-4e41-8f4d-0f62d6947f47)

- Added `Onboarding` as a support Target Type for convience.
- Made device inventory storage processes more efficient and started caching some often-accessed computer data (like computer names)

### Download ImmyBot Agent Installer Improvements


Updated the interface for downloading an immy agent installer. You can now assign default behavior to any of the installation methods. The `Deploy` tab will now automatically update when your computer shows up in ImmyBot.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/7ab85162-0ce8-49bd-ab16-a76a6c105dab)

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/b16dcf31-9e06-4f09-818f-bfff57c19f0f)

### Inventory Results over Service Bus (Beta)


Inventory scripts sent over any Rmm Provider connection will have their results sent over an Azure ServiceBus connection. This allows us to stream results in real-time, eliminating message size constraints. Since this is a new feature, you must manually enable this functionality under preferences. In a later release, we will extend the service bus script result handling to all scripts ran through Immy

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/e24d1489-c7fa-46ed-bde9-8a9bde0df04f)

### Recommended Deployments


A recommended deployment is a global deployment that is accessible to all ImmyBot users. Recommended deployments represent common scenarios that most companies use. You can approve / dismiss recommended deployments. Approving a deployment will allow it to be considered as a valid deployment when running maintenance. Dismissing a deployment will disallow it from being considered during maintenance.

When a new recommended deployment is added, you will receive a notification, "You have new recommended deployments". Clicking this link will prompt you to approve / disapprove the deployment.

You can manage the approval of all recommended deployments from the main Deployment List page by clicking the "View Recommended Deployments" button at the top.

### Deployment: Multiple Action Results


The deployment page can now show multiple action results. This is useful when a software has a configuration task or dependencies.

When there are 2 actions:

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/66e95cd9-7ec8-4c8e-b78e-20dc597194c5)

When there are more than 2 actions:

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/40f243cf-b00d-48b6-ae65-31d227c6959f)

Showing extra actions:

### Improvements


- Added license for Entity Framework Extensions
- Updated the descriptions for Windows Updates on the Schedule Page. We now hide the windows updates checkbox when it is not available.
  - ![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/9b4d861b-41ef-4039-8259-20689aa1b053)
- The error alert at the top of a page now indicates that the requested resource could not be found if the api call resulted in a 404.
  - ![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/1b419a4a-471a-49c0-983f-eea4d27e6eb3)

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed issue with merging tenants where some users were receiving the following error: `Configured execution strategy SqlServerRetryingExecutionStrategy does not support user initiated transactions `
- Fixed issues with determining winning deployments. A tenant filter script now has priority over a cross tenant filter script. Ordering has also been added to the target group filter. E.g. A deployment targeting primary domain controllers will now take priority over a deployment targeting servers.
- Fixed issue where multiple actions returned on the edit deployment screen would overwrite each other when previewing or deploying
- Fixed extra spacing between items on the computer software list
- Fixed issue where some null dates were showing as Jan 01 0001 - They now show as n/a.
- Fixed issue with creating, updating, and deleting deployments where the request would hang and eventually timeout
- Fixed issue with the deployment details page slug having duplicate text

## 0.42.2

### Improvements


- Added ability to merge and delete tenants
- Reduced agent install MSI from 41MB to 14MB
- ImmyAgent can now be installed without an internet connection
  - The Provisioning Package now embeds the MSI instead of downloading it, preventing the need for an internet
- ImmyAgent Service is now a single exe file
- ImmyAgent gracefully shuts down quickly preventing connection errors on service restart because the previous process is still running
- Better online/offline tracking: ImmyAgent now sends messages to the backend to indicate when it connects and disconnects. The prevents issues where a restart may not be noticed on machines that reboot quickly because the IoTHub filters out connection events that happen quickly.
- When joining the domain from the Onboarding screen, the logs indicate what domain controller is being used to fetch the offline domain join token
- When scripts are running in the Metascript context, we say execution is happening in the ImmyBot Backend instead of 'Server' as it could be confused with a server managed by ImmyBot

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed Offline Domain join
  - This also fixed an issue where Invoke-ImmyCommand would not respect the Computer argument
- Fixed issue where license values werent being provided during Onboarding sessions
- Fixed issue where PPKG would fail to apply if wireless was specified and the machine doesn't have a wireless adapter
- Fixed an issue with upgrades failing for global softwares that use choco provider
- Fixed an issue where cloud scripts were not able to be debugged with the correct script parameters from tenant session details
- Fixed issue causing deployments to fail when global software is linked to Ninite and Ninite integration is not enabled.
- Fixed an issue where rekeyed agents never show up in Immy.
- Fixed an issue with rerunning script from tenant session trying to run against a computer
- Fixed an issue that could cause the first instance of a schedule to not run if the schedule was created between your timezone's offset and midnight. (I.E Between 6PM CDT and Midnight CDT)

## 0.42.1

### Improvements and Bug Fixes


- Fixed an issue on the deployment form when invalid text would incorrectly show up when a chocolatey or ninite software was selected
- Fixed an issue that was preventing successful installs of ninite and chocolatey software

## 0.42.0

### Tenant Details Page


Added a tenant details page similar to the computer details page. The tenant list page link has been moved out from `Settings -> Tenants` to the top level in the navbar.

1. Maintenance sessions run directly against a tenant can be viewed in the Sessions tab.
1. Assigned Tenant Maintenance Tasks can be viewed in the Tasks tab.
1. The Terminal tab is auto scoped to run meta scripts for a particular tenant.
1. The Mappings tab allows you to link/un-link a tenant from RMM Providers.
1. The edit tab allows you to change the name of the tenant.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/33988012-0209-4220-9fa8-dc6a8211f3a2)

### Software Providers


#### What is a Software Provider?

A Software Provider tells ImmyBot how to install/uninstall a software. Currently, Local, Global, Chocolatey and Ninite are supported as providers. You can assign the available providers to a software on the software's edit page. A local/global software will inherently be a Local/Global Provider if there are software versions present.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/a54835ec-7977-48f4-85c6-b9cce0f53c5f)

The provider that is used during a maintenance session can be specified on the deployment. For example, if the Chocolatey provider is added on a software and is selected on a deployment, then Immy will always attempt to install/uninstall the software through Chocolatey.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/2ee5c1c5-0011-4f82-bb9b-983b4aafffcb)

If a specific provider is not selected, then the software will be installed/uninstalled using the following logic:

1. If the deployment is set to install the latest version or update if found, then the provider that contains the latest software version will be used.
   - e.g. If chocolatey has a newer software version then global, then chocolatey will be used.
1. For any other desired state, the local/global provider will be used (normal behavior).

If the Ninite integration is enabled and Ninite is set as an alternate provider, then Ninite will take priority over Local/Global and Chocolatey.

### Detection Outdated


Added a flag to computers to indicate that a deployment for the computer has been updated and that detection should be re-run to ensure the computer is up to date.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/1fbec2a1-cf19-402a-8118-4596c3d835dd)

### Computer Software Page Updates


Added more tabs to filter the computer's software list

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/8f25f22c-ab5d-4d7b-8ebd-db40321d6718)

#### Unassignable

The unassignable tab lists all software that exist on the computer but does not exist in ImmyBot as managed Software.

#### Assignable

The assignable tab now has two potential actions: **Quick Assign** and **Assign**. Quick Assign will immediately create a deployment targeting the primary person (if present) or the computer. A detection only session will also start immediately to determine the current state of the software. Assign will open the New Deployment Page and allow you to create a new assignment for the software. Quick assign is currently only available for software that do not have a configuration task or a license.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/396d2451-2e36-4793-b63f-99ed514bd536)

#### Assigned

The assigned tab now provides 3 potential actions: **Action to take (Install, Update, Enforce, etc)**, **Re-run detection (refresh icon)**, and **Manage (edit deployment)**"

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/016316a8-470a-42e8-a57a-b2c79ebb512f)

- String variables passed into a remote runspace now get expanded automatically just like running normal scripts, preventing the need to run ExpandString on variables containing paths like $InstallerFile and $InstallerFolder
  - ```powershell
    Invoke-ImmyCommand {
        # This is no longer necessary
        $InstallerFile = $ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.ExpandString($using:InstallerFile)

- Fixed an issue that prevented a user from resolving conflicts for new computers

## 0.41.8

Released 2021-04-06

### Bug Fixes and Improvements


- Added the most recently updated computers by default in the computer dropdown on the deployment form

- Improved SSL certificate handling

## 0.41.6

Released 2021-03-30

### Configuration Tasks


Added better support for Software Configuration Tasks by allowing a maintenance task to be checked off as a Configuration Task.

Configuration Tasks are used to provide parameters to software install scripts and/or provide additional configuration after the software is installed. Checking this box allows you to select this Maintenance Task from the Configuration Task section of the 'Edit Software' page. Configuration Tasks are not select-able on the 'Edit Deployment' Page to prevent accidental deployment without the associated software.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/ec4caad0-653c-47e1-9ed3-4cc465e62e2e)

The Configuration Task selector on the Software Edit Page now only show maintenance tasks that have Configuration Task checked.

### Recommended Software and Maintenance Tasks


Added the ability to mark a software or maintenance task as _Recommended_.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/635573a1-b763-400c-b9f8-c2328b1f60c4)

The Maintenance Item selector in the Edit Deployment Screen will push Software and Maintenance Tasks marked as recommended to the top of the list, making it easier to disambiguate packages that exist in multiple repositories.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/d930984c-6bea-437e-a943-1401b88a3ad9)

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/e73663be-9474-49b0-bb15-859bc298a554)

Added new filters to the top of the software list page

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/040c029c-a56a-49a7-a1bd-55b65ba211dc)

Added new filters to the top of the maintenance task list page

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/9a226551-a7f5-434a-9224-20abcb4b5889)

### Bug Fixes and Other Improvements

- Hid maintenance actions on the computer's software list where the desired state is not present and the software is missing
- Added the computer's name to the page title on the computer details page.
- Fixed a bug with previewing and deploying tenant maintenance tasks on the deployment page
- Fixed a bug with saving tenant maintenance tasks
- Fixed issue with previewing offline computers on the deployment page

## 0.41.0

Released 2021-03-23

### Software Icons

QOL feature where we added the ability to upload icons to software that can be displayed in software lists.

We will incrementally start adding icons to Global Software and displaying the icons on various pages where software are shown, such as the Dashboard and Maintenance Session Details pages.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/87ac591e-eba5-401f-b80d-850940b3e5ca)

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/252f3f9b-2927-472f-9790-defb29ff0188)

#### Media


ImmyBot now officially supports uploading media that can be used in Maintenance Tasks as file parameters. Existing media can now be selected from the media library for re-use on multiple maintenance tasks.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/fd69024e-cbf5-4940-8dfa-b42c25c7e886)

#### Detection Only Maintenance Sessions


Detection only maintenance sessions are replacing the "Preview" feature where we determine what needs to be done for a computer to be compliant without actually enforcing compliance. The benefit over the old "preview" is that detection only maintenance sessions will persist to the database.

A detection only session will gather all deployments for a computer, and if the computer is online, it will then run detection to determine compliance. If the computer is offline, it will only determine what the desired state is.

#### Additional computer software list filtering


Added additional filtering to the computer's software list that allows you to filter by managed software, inventoried software, or both. Also, a toggle to show "Hidden Items" was added to show or hide system component inventoried software.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/0e0cc80d-3e40-496b-aace-fcf3025f38d4)

#### Max session indicator


Updated the Sessions List page headers to show Created Sessions and the max number of running sessions Immy can run concurrently.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/3f27e7c1-89aa-4caf-8654-677be3f9297e)

### Bug fixes and other improvements

- Added some extra information to BITS failure logs

## 0.40.3

Released 2021-03-12

### Bug Fixes

Fixed a bug in the ImmyBot Agent where devices would fail the re-key request when the serial number changed.

## 0.40.2

Released 2021-03-08

### Azure Improvements

----Added the ability to create tenants from your Azure Customers from the Azure page. This is convenient for those only using the ImmyBot Agent, and want to quickly create tenants from their Azure Customers. We also added the Azure Customer Domain to the table since this may be valuable to see.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/22e52fe4-1739-49e3-b624-d3cd307be64b)

### Chocolatey Improvements


Our managed server that proxies and caches Chocolatey requests can at times be unreliable. Also, this server is not geographically replicated so it is not the best solution for those using ImmyBot outside of the US. We added logic that automatically falls back to using Chocolatey directly whenever our managed server is responding poorly. We also improved our caching which resulted in better response times and fewer requests sent to Chocolatey.

### Script Session Logs Improvements


Updated the styling of script session logs. Clicking "Open Debugger" now copies the script output to the terminal.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/0681edc0-c106-4e2c-8ed9-649cd7fe3473)

### Schedule Improvements


The default detection time for new schedules has been changed to 2PM. The default execution time for new schedules has been changed to 10PM. Extra details were added to detection and execution time descriptions on new schedule form.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/8f1f906f-4e21-4f16-998e-32f4563f600d)

### Deployment Improvements


Deployment options more clearly indicate that they will only affect sessions created on the deployment page and will not be saved with the deployment itself.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/dae05886-dc34-46fb-871a-582992fc75fa)

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed an issue with the software auto update method `Add-SoftwareVersion` where it would not accept valid versions.
- Fixed an issue in Firefox where clicking inside the "Download ImmyBot Agent Installer" dropdown closed the dropdown
- Fixed issues in computer software list where local and global software/tasks did not have links
- Fixed an issue with displaying emails in the iPhone mail app, where the body of the email was very small
- Fixed a bug during renaming a computer where it would still attempt the rename even if the computer already had the desired name
- Fixed bug where CWA RMM Link form was not verifying correctly when manual entry code was filled-out then cleared
- Added validations to ensure that CW Automate manual entry codes are at least 7 digits in length and must contain only alpha-numeric characters
- Fixed issue with Immy Emails having the wrong action text
- Fixed metascript output logs not showing up as primary highlighted logs
- Removed duplicate output log from cloud scripts
- Fixed an issue where logs were unclear if download failed

## 0.40.1

Released 2021-03-01

### Added PPKG option to disable hibernation

Set to true by default.

### Schedule specific maintenance items alert message


Added an alert message on the schedule details page to better clarify why some computers may not have maintenance sessions started.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/7d7ccc18-bb2b-49b1-9032-3bf74ab3192d)

### Improved Custom Detection Script logic


Custom Detection Scripts can now return any output as long as the last word is a valid semantic version.

#### Example

```powershell
write-output "The version found is 1.0.0" ## translates to a detected version of 1.0.0
write-output "Version:`n`n1.0.0" ## translates to a detected version of 1.0.0
```

### Bug Fixes


1. Fixed issues with setting appropriate fields when the analyzer returns data for an uploaded software
1. Fixed an issue where new computers were not getting moved to onboarding after being identified if the computer already existed.
1. Fixed an issue when re-installing with the uninstall/install method, where the installer failed to downloaded and left the software uninstalled
1. Replaced the word "undetermined" in Immy emails with a blank
1. Fixes an issue displaying output logs for cloud scripts on the deployment page
1. Fixed configuration task search not using case-insensitive searching.
1. Configuration Task selector now shows 5 most recently updated items by default
1. Fixed a bug where the view software buttons on the Software List Page were missing
1. Fixed an issue with software version test script logic that was triggering a re-install when the test script did not explicitly return `false`. Test scripts must now explicitly return `false` in order to trigger a re-install. Returning `null`, `""`, and `0` will not trigger a re-install.
1. Enabled the metascript execution context for custom detection scripts
1. Removed the "all scripts are disabled for task" alert on the deployment form for configuration tasks
1. Fixed a bug on the deployment form where it would not let you save if you changed the selected maintenance item from one software to another
1. Fixed a bug on the deployment form where it would not keep your selected desired state when changing the selected maintenance item from one software to another
1. Fixed a bug preventing the logout button from working

## 0.40.0

Released 2021-02-24

#### Dashboard Page


Added a new page that can provide you the latest actions for software and maintenance tasks that were run against a group of computers. The page is intended to help produce audits and show whether or not computers are compliant. This page is a work in progress and will be iterated on over the next few weeks.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/7a0c32f8-3011-450a-94a1-2633b6a65c09)

##### How to use it

1. Select a target scope for the computers you are interested in.
1. Select one or more software or maintenance tasks
1. The table will then show you a green check, a red x, or nothing to indicate the compliance of the selected item for that computer
   - A green check indicates that the latest action for the item is compliant.
   - A red x indicates that the latest action for the item is not compliant.
   - Nothing indicates that ImmyBot has not run an action against the computer for the item.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/22f43392-98f8-42f5-9923-4ef171a657f5)

- You can filter the data for each software or maintenance task added by clicking the filter button next to the item's name.
- You can remove an item from the table by clicking the red X button next to the item's name.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/532a234c-7deb-44aa-8097-e1be0465ada6)

- Click the `xlsx` button located at the top-right corner of the table to export the data in the table.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/2cc6c4be-09a2-489c-876e-18c8fcdd10b0)

- The excel export will contain an "Overview" worksheet, that provides you the compliancy of the selected software and tasks for each computer.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/555ff1ca-f2f9-47bd-967b-b7a7ae111e7f)

- For each software and task you have in the table, an additional worksheet will be added that provides you information about the latest action taken.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/8d1bb0b7-ca66-427d-bb27-4d08cdccda76)

#### Restart ImmyBot


Added a **Restart ImmyBot** button to the System Status Page. The System Status Page has been moved to the top of the navbar.

_Note_: Only MSP Admin users can see this page.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/830b95ea-9f95-4d35-b878-27de5ddb4303)

#### Get-RmmInstallScript Metascript


Exposed new metascript `Get-RmmInstallSCript -RmmLinkId <int>` that will return a script block containing the powershell install script for the specified rmm link. This is was added to provide an quick way to update the ImmyBot Agent on computers. Long term, we will add auto update logic to the ImmyBot Agents so we don't have to do this.

##### Example usage

```powershell
$RmmInfo = Get-RmmInfo -ProviderType ImmybotAgent
$ScriptBlock = Get-RmmInstallScript -RmmLinkId $RmmInfo.RmmLinkId
Invoke-ImmyCommand $ScriptBlock
```

#### Improved Software Detection


We expanded the "Software Table" detection method to have three search modes: Contains, Regex, and Traditional.

We added a lookup table that can search the known software on your computers to help create better detection methods.

The **Contains** search mode allows you to target software using a contains search.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/2fd1fa6c-7a5a-4e1f-b31b-2a8f25df8c0c)

The **Regex** search mode allows to target software using regular expressions.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/acb119f1-2b67-4ccc-85f4-cb51ed455f93)

The **Traditional** search mode is the old detection style used by ImmyBot. This method is essentially the same as Regex, but replaces occurrences of _ with ._

##### Software Lookup Table


The table will show software already installed on your computers that matches the detection method you provide.

We provide the software name, version, upgrade code (if present), and how many computers in your instance have it installed.

Added a software repair option to the Software Details Page

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/c399015c-161c-4548-bd83-570ec932248c)

On a computer's software tab, you can now click a repair button that will perform the specified repair logic.

## 0.37.5

Check out our new documentation site! https://docs.immy.bot/

##### Actionable Software Inventory

- Updated the _Software_ tab to now provide actionable buttons for software and maintenance tasks that are not compliant

- Write-Host output is no longer suppressed when run within Invoke-ImmyCommand
- Write-Debug, Write-Verbose, Write-Warning, and Write-Error all work both within Metascripts, and scripts run via Invoke-ImmyCommand (Note: $DebugPreference and $VerbosePreference need to be set to 'Continue' as the PowerShell default will suppress the output from these cmdlets)

## 0.36.4

Released 2020-11-19
